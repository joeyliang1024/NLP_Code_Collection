人講做官若清廉，食飯著攪鹽。,"Lâng kóng tsò-kuann nā tshing-liâm, tsia̍h-pn̄g tio̍h kiáu iâm.",人家說當官如果清廉，生活就會清苦,"People say that if you are an honest official, your life will be frugal.","Lâng kóng chò-koaⁿ nā chheng-liâm, chia̍h-pn̄g tio̍h kiáu iâm."
頭毛留長長，儉錢食塗豆糖。,"Thâu-mn̂g lâu tn̂g-tn̂g, khiām-tsînn tsia̍h thôo-tāu-thn̂g.",頭髮留那麼長還不剪，莫非是想把錢省下來買花生糖吃。,"If you don't cut your hair even though it's so long, could it be that you want to save money to buy peanut candy to eat?","Thâu-mn̂g lâu tn̂g-tn̂g, khiām-chîⁿ chia̍h thô͘-tāu-thn̂g."
